Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning
This project implements a stock price prediction model using Random Forest Regression to analyze historical data and forecast closing prices.

Functionality:
Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
Cleans and preprocesses the data using pandas.
Creates features based on historical closing prices (e.g., moving averages) for model training.
Trains a Random Forest Regression model using scikit-learn to predict future closing prices.
Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Visualizes actual vs. predicted prices using pandas and matplotlib.

Usage:
Install dependencies:
pip install yfinance pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

Run the program:
python main.py

Enter a stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "TSLA") or "exit" to quit.

The program will:
Display the retrieved historical data.
Train the prediction model.
Print the predicted price for the next day.
Optionally, visualize actual vs. predicted closing prices.

Disclaimer
This is a basic implementation for educational purposes only. Stock price prediction is inherently uncertain, and this model should not be used for financial decision-making.

Libraries Used
yfinance: Fetches historical financial data.
pandas: Provides data manipulation and analysis tools.
scikit-learn: Offers machine learning algorithms and tools.
matplotlib: Creates visualizations like plots and charts.

Further Development
Explore other machine learning models like LSTMs or Prophet for time series forecasting.
Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
Integrate technical indicators for feature engineering.
Add backtesting capabilities to evaluate model performance on historical data.
Develop a user interface for interactive exploration and prediction.
